# Fullcalendar::Bootstrap::Rails

1. Want to display the events in your Rails app as a calendar?  
  [FullCalendar][fullcalendar] is a quick and dirty way to do it.
2. Want it all bundled up nicely as an asset gem for use with Rails' asset pipeline?
  [fullcalendar-rails][fullcalendar-rails] is one of the best options.
3. Tried to make it look consistent with the rest of your [Bootstrap][bootstrap]-powered views?
  Welcome!

## Installation

Add this gem and its [momentjs][moment] dependency to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'momentjs-rails'
gem 'fullcalendar-bootstrap-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fullcalendar-bootstrap-rails

At this point, the files from the FullCalendar project are in your asset 
pipeline's pathâ€¦ all you have to do is require them in the appropriate places.

Here is an example:
* CSS:
  ```scss
  // app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss

  @import "bootstrap-sprockets";
  @import "bootstrap";
  // after the bootstrap dependency
  @import "fullcalendar";
  ```

* javascript:
  ```js
  // app/assets/javascripts/application.js

  //= require bootstrap-sprockets
  //= require moment
  // after the bootstrap and moment dependencies
  //= require fullcalendar
  ```

For more details and options, check the [fullcalendar-rails installation section][fullcalendar-rails-install].

### A note on versioning

First noticed this type of versioning with @bokmann's [fullcalendar-rails][fullcalendar-rails]:

> I am going to version this gem with the version of the FullCalendar code I use, adding an extra digit if I need to release any maintenance versions of the gem itself.

Makes sense to me: It's [Semantic Versioning][semver], just that a different semantic. I'm inheriting it, this way you can explicitly require a specific version of FullCalendar, if available:

    gem 'fullcalendar-bootstrap-rails', '~> 2.3.1.0'

where the digit after the [semantical patch version][semver] indicates the release of this gem.

## Usage

I mean, not much to say here. You're more interested in how to use [FullCalendar][fullcalendar].

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
