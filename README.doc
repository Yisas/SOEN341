# COMP341 - Software Process

This is a website created for the COMP341 course at Concordia University. It has been developped using the Ruby on Rails framework. A deployed version may be found at https://glacial-temple-1873.herokuapp.com/, though I can't promise it won't be taken down by the time anyone reads this.
